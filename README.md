## ðŸŒ€ Scrum Methodology Applied

This project followed the Scrum framework from initiation to delivery. Our team structured the work into five sprints, each culminating in a functional increment of the product. Here's how we applied Scrum in practice:

### ðŸ§  Roles Defined  
- **Product Owner**: Prioritized features and maintained clarity of requirements  
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitated standups, removed blockers, and enforced Scrum principles  
- **Development Team**: Collaboratively delivered working features in each sprint

### ðŸ“‹ Scrum Artifacts  
- **Product Backlog**: Dynamic and prioritized by value  
- **Sprint Backlogs**: Focused on specific deliverables tied to goals  
- **Increments**: Delivered working versions at the end of every sprint  
- **Burndown Charts**: Visualized sprint progress and team velocity

### ðŸ”„ Scrum Events  
- **Sprint Planning**: Defined scope, estimated tasks using story points  
- **Daily Stand-ups**: Synchronized the team, discussed blockers and progress  
- **Sprint Reviews**: Demonstrated work to stakeholders for feedback  
- **Sprint Retrospectives**: Reflected and iterated on team process improvements

### âœ… What I Learned from Scrum  
- How to decompose high-level features into well-defined user stories  
- The importance of team roles, ceremonies, and timeboxing  
- Managing and adapting to changing requirements mid-sprint  
- Using iterative development to continuously add value  
- Collaborating using agile boards like Trello or GitHub Projects to track sprint work
